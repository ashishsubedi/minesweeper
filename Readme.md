# Minesweeper Game

## Description

This is my version of minesweeper made in one and half day (more or less). This is very simple and basic so don't even expect much from this. Made using PyGame which I just learned during this build. 

## How to Play

- Download and run <code> python main.py </code> to play.
- By default:
    * 30 mines
    * 30 flags
    * 10x10 grid
- ## You can change these values at top of the <code> main.py </code> file.

### Controls

- Left click to show number. The first cell you click is always safe.
- Right click to flag. You have exactly same number of flags as mines.
- White, Unknown
- Blue, safe square
- Red, Mine
- Green, Flagged
